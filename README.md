# Documentation

## Service modules
* The [cf](services/cf.js) module is encapsulating Contentful's specifics like the API key, as well as constants for content type identifiers
* The [blog](services/blog.js) module is a service taking care of calling Contentful and normalizing the results from the API

## View
* The main CSS structure comes from the [Bootstrap blog template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) it is defined in the [layout](views/layout.jade) template.

* Blog posts rendering is handled in the [mixins](views/mixins.jade), so it can be reused in the [category](views/category.jade) and [index](views/index.jade) views.
